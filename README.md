## My process
### Built with
- Visual Code Studio
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned how to apply some basic but readable flexbox. I'm particularly happy with how the .container turned out.

```css
.container{
    width: 280px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 16px;
    border-radius: 18px;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development
I wanna keep improving my layout knowledge. I still feel like I have much to learn in this regard.
